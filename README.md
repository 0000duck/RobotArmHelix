This is a simple project developed in C# by using [helix-tookit](https://github.com/helix-toolkit/helix-toolkit). In order to compile this project the DLLs of Helix need to be compiled by downloading the source code from the helix repository and compiling them.

The aim of the project was to test forward and inverse kinematics which has been achieved thanks to helix and wpf. The Inverse kinematics has been developed on the base of http://www.alanzucconi.com/2017/04/10/robotic-arms/, it is in fact based on gradient descent.
